# Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to accurately predict the manner in which the subject completed the exercise - known as the "classe" variable in the following datasets. 

I build a model using cross-validation to reduce the out of sample error rate. 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
